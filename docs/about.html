<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>
    I am a passionate software engineer with a diverse skill set and a strong focus on quality. I have experience with front-end and back-end development and a keen interest in software architecture and design. I enjoy finding innovative solutions to complex problems and take great pride in delivering work that meets the needs of my clients. I also appreciate working collaboratively and communicating effectively with others. While I am confident in my skills, I remain humble and open to learning from others and continuing to grow as a professional.

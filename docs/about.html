<p>
    I am a passionate software engineer with a diverse skill set and a strong focus on quality. I have experience with front-end and back-end development and a keen interest in software architecture and design. I enjoy finding innovative solutions to complex problems and take great pride in delivering work that meets the needs of my clients. I also appreciate working collaboratively and communicating effectively with others. While I am confident in my skills, I remain humble and open to learning from others and continuing to grow as a professional.

    Outside of work, I'm a big fan of the TV show "Person of Interest". I love the character of Harold Finch and his unique approach to solving problems. His mindset and dedication to finding creative solutions is truly inspiring. In fact, my username, singularvoice, is a nod to the final quote of the show, "If you can hear this, you're alone. The only thing left of me is the sound of my voice." This quote speaks to the power of an individual's voice and the impact it can have on others, even after they're gone
